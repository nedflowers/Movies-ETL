# Movies-ETL

## Summary of Project
A popular streaming company would like to create an algorithm that predicts which low-budgets films set to release will perform best at the box-office. This requires a clean database. Create an automated pipeline that accepts one function to read and parse three filesâ€”Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data. Then, perform the Extract Transform Load (ETL) process by adding the data to a clean PostgreSQL database.
